Step by step guide to compile the project:

1) Our project was made in Eclipse with the newest version of Java SE. We can only guarantee no compiler errors when this is the case.

2) In Eclipse, select import --> Existing Projects into workspace --> Choose the "MarioAI2012" folder --> Press Finish

3) In Eclipse, navigate to "MarioAI2012\MarioAI\src\ch\idsia\scenarios\Play.java"

4) This is the main class and the project can be run from here. There are several options that can be tuned, such as:
		4a) "marioAIOptions.setLevelDifficulty(x)" - used to change the difficulty of the map
		4b) "marioAIOptions.setEnemies(off/on)" - used to change whether or not enemies spawn

5) All of our code can be found in "MarioAI2012\MarioAI\src\fagproject\"
		5a) The main class for our code where everything starts is "AStarAgent.java".
